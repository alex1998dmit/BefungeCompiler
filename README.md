## What is Befunge ?

Befunge is a stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language. It differs from conventional languages in that programs are arranged on a two-dimensional grid. "Arrow" instructions direct the control flow to the left, right, up or down, and loops are constructed by sending the control flow in a cycle. It has been described as "a cross between Forth and Lemmings.
Program example: 
```
>                          v
@,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hello World!"<
```

Result: HelloWolrd!

## Guide

1) To start, you need to create a separate text file with the Befunge program. (for example hello.txt, helloWorld.txt, stackOperations.txt at directory)
2) Select the required file
